# Prosoft Programming Exercise

# Requirements I could not implement
  - Display in orange days that are holidays
  - Display in grey any days in the week previous to the Start date
  - Display in grey any days in the week after the last rendered day
  - Holidays   must   be   dynamically   extracted   from   the   API

  
# Bugs I’ve identified but didn’t have time to fix
  - There is an error when sending the form with only the start date (with empty number of days)
  - There is an error when sending the form with only the start date (with empty country code)
  - There is an error when sending a country code that has no data in the API
  - There is an error when typing an invalid date in the start_date field (i.e.: using month #13)
  - There is an error when typing an invalid date in the start_date field (i.e.: using day #32)
  - There is an error when typing an invalid date in the start_date field (i.e.: using year #0001)


# Things I would do if I had more time to complete the task
  - Provide a better UI
  - Display additional data like amount of days, amount of months and amount of holidays in search span
  - Display a datepicker instead of an open input field in start_date field to avoid users from choosing invalid dates


# Additional notes
  - Although I've had a git account for years, I had never really used it before (I've never had to share code), I wrote the code yesterday and I did try to stick to the 2.5 hours but I must admit I may have gotten a little over excited and I took a few extra minutes to see how far I could get.
  - The code is already pulling dates out of the API, I could have finished all of the requirements with no problem if only I had more time, I hope you like my code so we can work together :)
  - Just in case, you can see a live demo on this test domain: http://almacen123.com/
  - Please let me know if there is anything else I can do and thanks so much for the opportunity, looking forward to hearing from you!
